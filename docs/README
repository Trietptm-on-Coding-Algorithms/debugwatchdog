Debug Watchdog
=============================

Debug Watchdog is a tool for globally monitoring your Linux system and
stopping chosen executable binaries immediately after launched. This
enables to attach a debugger from the first instruction or to explore
binary parameters -even for short-living processes-. Every executable
binary is caught: no matter which user launched it, when nor for how
long the process is expected to live. This is achieved by patching the
system calls table in kernel spaces and hooking the sys_execve system
call. The original system table values are restored when Debug Watchdog
is turned off.

Debug Watchdog has the following components:

 * Kernel driver
 * Library
 * Automated test
 * UI

Only one Debug Watchdog instance is allowed to run on a system at a time.

Requirements to run
=============================

 * Linux x86_64
 * Qt5 libraries
 * gnome-terminal
 * gdb
 * glibc

Debug Watchdog requires CAP_SYS_MODULE capabilities to work, as a
kernel module has to be dynamically loaded. "root" user usually
satisfies this condition.

Run the automated test to make sure that your system meets the 
requirements and binaries will be caught: ./bin/debugwatchdogtest

Run from the UI: ./bin/debugwatchdogui

Debug Watchdog is known to work in the following systems:

 * Fedora 25 - Linux kernel 4.12.12-200

How to build
=============================

Install the following build dependencies:

 * QtCreator
 * gcc
 * Linux kernel headers
 * glibc headers

Config:

 * Edit deploy.sh and:
  * set KERNEL_HEADERS_PATH variable pointing to your kernel headers
  * review other configurations (i.e.: debug or release build)

Run builder:

 * ./deploy.sh
  * Binaries will be placed in "bin" folder.
