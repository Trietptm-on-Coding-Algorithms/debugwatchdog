Debug Watchdog
=============================

Debug Watchdog is a tool to globally monitor your Linux system and
stop watched executable binaries immediately after launched. This
allows to attach a debugger on the first instruction and to explore
binary parameters. Every executable binary is caught: no matter who
launched it, when or how long the process lives. To achieve this,
kernel syscalls table is patched and sys_execve hooked. Original
syscalls table values are restored when Debug Watchdog is turned off.

Debug Watchdog has the following components:

 * Kernel driver
 * Library
 * Automated test
 * UI

Only one Debug Watchdog instance is allowed to run on a system at a time.

Requirements to run
=============================

 * Linux x86_64
 * Qt5 libraries
 * gnome-terminal
 * gdb
 * glibc

Debug Watchdog requires CAP_SYS_MODULE capabilities to work, as a
kernel module has to be dynamically loaded. "root" user usually
satisfies this condition.

Run the automated test to make sure that your system meets the 
requirements and binaries are caught: ./bin/debugwatchdogtest

Run from the UI: ./bin/debugwatchdogui

Debug Watchdog is known to work in the following systems:

 * Fedora 25 - Linux kernel 4.13.16-101

How to build
=============================

Install the following build dependencies:

 * QtCreator
 * gcc
 * Linux kernel headers
 * glibc headers

Config:

 * Edit deploy.sh and:
  * set KERNEL_HEADERS_PATH variable pointing to your kernel headers
  * review other configurations (i.e.: debug or release build)

Run builder:

 * ./deploy.sh
  * Binaries will be placed in "bin" folder, and "bin.tar.gz" file (packing all binaries) generated.
