// NOTES:
//
// 1) This library will handle SIGUSR1 signal. This signal has to be
//    blocked in all of your process threads. This can be achieved by
//    statically linking this library or by dynamically loading it
//    from the process main thread. Do not enable SIGUSR1 handling in
//    any thread nor wait for the signal.
//
// 2) This library will terminate the process immediately if an error
//    that leaves the library in an undefined state occurs (i.e. during
//    initialization or finalization). Some failures are handable. If
//    setting a custom fatal error handler, it's your responsability not
//    to do further calls on any library method.
